<!--<SHORT-PRESENTATION> -->
🚀 A **3D "voxel" rendering engine**, built **entirely from scratch** using **only JavaScript, CSS, and HTML**.  

It’s **a voxel engine that refuses to acknowledge that it shouldn't exist** 😆.  
<!--</SHORT-PRESENTATION>-->


## **🔹 Technical Highlights**  
- **Fully DOM-based rendering** → Each voxel are **`<div>`**, transformed in 3D using `rotate3d()`, `perspective`, and `transform`.  
- **No WebGL, No Canvas, No external libraries** → Just raw **CSS + JS**.  
- **Optimized for performance** → Uses **GPU-accelerated CSS** to handle rendering efficiently.  
- **Neon cyberpunk aesthetic** → Styled with **box-shadow, blend modes, and CSS filters**.  

## **🧐 Why is this interesting?**  
Most 3D voxel engines rely on **WebGL or Canvas**, but this one runs purely in the **DOM**.  

CSS and JS are pushed to their limits to create a DOM **3D engine** that's **fast, efficient, and visually striking**.
